## Contents

1. [Condenser](#condenser)
2. [Make Calendar](#make-calendar)

## Condenser

The Condenser project consists of the following files:

- [condense.py](./code/condenser/condense.py): This Python script condenses files of a specific file type by merging their contents into a single output file.

The `condense.py` script takes a file type as input and walks through the directory tree, collecting file paths and contents of matching file types. It then writes the file paths and contents to a single output file, separated by decoration lines.

- [requirements.txt](./code/make_calendar/requirements.txt): This file lists the Python packages required to run the Create ICS File script.
- [schedule.ics](./code/make_calendar/schedule.ics): This file is an example of an iCalendar (.ics) file that contains a predefined set of events.
- [create_ics_file.py](./code/make_calendar/create_ics_file.py): This Python script generates an .ics file with a predefined set of events that can be imported into calendar applications.

- [improvements.md](./code/make_calendar/improvements.md): This file lists potential improvements and features that can be added to the Make Calendar project.
